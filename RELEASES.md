# Releases

This page describes how to install and use our release artifacts for ROCm and
external builds like PyTorch and JAX. We produce build artifacts as part of our
Continuous Integration (CI) build/test workflows as well as release artifacts as
part of Continuous Delivery (CD) nightly releases.

For the development status of GPU architecture support in TheRock, please see
[SUPPORTED_GPUS.md](./SUPPORTED_GPUS.md) which tracks release readiness for each
AMD GPU architecture.

## Multi-arch releases

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are introducing multi-arch releases with
> [#3323](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/3323). Rather than build
> ROCm for GPU family subsets like the [per-family releases](#per-family-releases),
> these multi-arch releases build all GPU architectures together and split
> GPU-specific code (kernel packs) from architecture-neutral host code as a
> packaging step.
>
> This new setup will streamline package installation, so please note the
> differences in the install instructions.

Key differences from [per-family releases](#per-family-releases):

- **One index URL for all GPUs**: select your target with a pip extra like
  `[device-gfx942]` instead of finding a per-family index URL
- **Broader GPU support**: adding support for a new GPU target is just one
  more device package, so more GPUs can be supported without impacting build
  times or download sizes for other targets
- **Smaller downloads**: kernels downloads can be scoped to a single GPU
  instead of always being scoped to a family or "all"

### Installing multi-arch ROCm Python packages

Nightly releases of ROCm and related Python packages are published to a unified
index at https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/whl-multi-arch/.

> [!TIP]
> We highly recommend working within a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
>
> ```bash
> python -m venv .venv
> source .venv/bin/activate
> ```
>
> Multiple virtual environments can be present on a system at a time, allowing you to switch between them at will.

> [!WARNING]
> If you _really_ want a system-wide install, you can pass `--break-system-packages` to `pip` outside a virtual environment.
> In this case, commandline interface shims for executables are installed to `/usr/local/bin`, which normally has precedence over `/usr/bin` and might therefore conflict with a previous installation of ROCm.

We provide several Python packages which together form the complete ROCm SDK.
In multi-arch releases, GPU-specific device code is split into separate
`rocm-sdk-device-{target}` packages.

- See [ROCm Python Packaging via TheRock](./docs/packaging/python_packaging.md)
  for information about each package.
- The packages are defined in the
  [`build_tools/packaging/python/templates/`](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/tree/main/build_tools/packaging/python/templates)
  directory.

| Package name               | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `rocm`                     | Primary sdist meta package that dynamically determines other deps  |
| `rocm-sdk-core`            | OS-specific core of the ROCm SDK (e.g. compiler and utility tools) |
| `rocm-sdk-libraries`       | OS-specific libraries (architecture-neutral host code)             |
| `rocm-sdk-device-{target}` | GPU-specific device code (e.g. `rocm-sdk-device-gfx942`)           |
| `rocm-sdk-devel`           | OS-specific development tools                                      |

Install ROCm with device support for your GPU using the unified index:

> [!WARNING]
> A `device-*` extra (or a single-family per-architecture index) being
> installable does **not** mean the runtime is functional on that target.
> Targets without ✅ in **Sanity Tested** in
> [SUPPORTED_GPUS.md](SUPPORTED_GPUS.md) are unverified. `pip install` will
> succeed, but device enumeration, kernel launch, or library loads may fail at
> runtime. Please file an issue if you hit one.

```bash
# Replace device-gfx942 with your GPU, see the section below for details
pip install --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/whl-multi-arch/ "rocm[libraries,device-gfx942]"
```

<!-- TODO: Advertise wheel variants / WheelNext once available  -->

After installing, verify your installation:

```bash
rocm-sdk test
```

#### Supported Python `[device-*]` install extras

For packages which include device-specific code (such as `rocm`, `torch`, and
`torchvision`), support for individual devices can be installed using the
corresponding `device-*` extra from the table below. See also the
[GPU architecture specs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/reference/gpu-arch-specs.html)
for a full list of supported AMD GPUs.

#### The Python `[device-all]` install extra

A `[device-all]` extra is also provided which installs device code for all GPUs.

> [!WARNING]
> The `[device-all]` extra may not work consistently for nightly releases because
> packages are promoted per-target as they pass tests. If tests are still
> running or if they failed for an individual target, this extra will not be
> able to find all required packages.
>
> We also publish **untested** packages to the nightly "whl-staging-multi-arch"
> index which is not affected by this limitation.
>
> | Package index                                          | Safe to use `[device-all]`?                              |
> | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
> | https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/whl-multi-arch/         | ❌ No (some packages may not be available)               |
> | https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/whl-staging-multi-arch/ | ✅ Yes (index includes all packages, even if tests fail) |

<!-- TODO: add repo.amd.com URL to the list of package indexes once we publish a stable release? -->

### Installing multi-arch PyTorch Python packages

Install PyTorch with ROCm support using the same unified index:

```bash
# Replace device-gfx942 with your GPU, see the section above for details
# Note: we'll recommend 'whl-multi-arch' instead of 'whl-staging-multi-arch'
#       as soon as we test run automate tests on these packages
pip install --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/whl-staging-multi-arch/ \
    "torch[device-gfx942]" "torchvision[device-gfx942]" torchaudio

# Optional additional packages on Linux:
#   apex
```

> [!TIP]
> The device extras install GPU-specific packages like `amd-torch-device-gfx1100`
> which contain GPU-specific kernels and depend on `rocm-sdk-device-gfx1100`.
> The compatible ROCm packages are installed automatically, you do not need to
> install ROCm separately:
>
> ```bash
> pip install --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/whl-staging-multi-arch/ \
>     "torch[device-gfx1100]"
>
> pip freeze  # with approximate download sizes:
> # rocm-sdk-core==7.13.0a...              ~700 MB
> # rocm-sdk-libraries==7.13.0a...         ~100 MB  (host code, shared across GPUs)
> # rocm-sdk-device-gfx1100==7.13.0a...     ~50 MB  (only gfx1100 device code)
> # torch==2.11.0+rocm...                  ~100 MB  (host code, shared across GPUs)
> # amd-torch-device-gfx1100==2.11.0+...    ~50 MB  (only gfx1100 device code)
> # Total:                                 ~1.1 GB
> #
> # For comparison, a similar per-family (non-multi-arch) torch wheel for
> # gfx110X-all [gfx1100, gfx1101, gfx1102, gfx1103] is ~600 MB.
> ```

After installing, verify PyTorch can see your GPU:

```python
import torch

print(torch.cuda.is_available())
# True
print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
# e.g. AMD Radeon Pro W7900 Dual Slot
```

See [external-builds/pytorch/README.md](/external-builds/pytorch/README.md) for
more details on supported PyTorch versions and building from source.

### Installing multi-arch tarballs

Standalone "ROCm SDK tarballs" are a flattened view of ROCm
[artifacts](docs/development/artifacts.md) matching the familiar folder
structure seen with system installs on Linux to `/opt/rocm/` or on Windows via
the HIP SDK:

```bash
install/
  .kpack/     # GPU-specific kernel packs (multi-arch only)
  bin/
  clients/
  include/
  lib/
  libexec/
  share/
```

Tarballs are _just_ these raw files. They do not come with "install" steps
such as setting environment variables.

Multi-arch tarballs separate GPU-specific kernel code into a `.kpack/`
directory. Two variants are available:

- **Per-family tarballs** (e.g. `therock-dist-linux-gfx110X-all-7.13.0a20260430.tar.gz`)
  that include `.kpack` files only for one family.
- **Multiarch tarball** (e.g. `therock-dist-linux-multiarch-7.13.0a20260430.tar.gz`)
  that include `.kpack` files for all supported targets.

Browse and download tarballs from
https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/tarball-multi-arch/.

To download and extract:

```bash
mkdir therock-tarball && cd therock-tarball

# Per-family (smaller, one GPU family):
wget https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/tarball-multi-arch/therock-dist-linux-gfx110X-all-7.13.0a20260430.tar.gz

# Or multiarch (all GPUs):
wget https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/tarball-multi-arch/therock-dist-linux-multiarch-7.13.0a20260430.tar.gz

mkdir install && tar -xf *.tar.gz -C install
```

After extraction, test the install:

```bash
./install/bin/rocminfo
ls install/.kpack/
# blas_lib_gfx1100.kpack  fft_lib_gfx1100.kpack  rand_lib_gfx1100.kpack  ...
```

> [!TIP]
> You may also want to add parts of the install directory to your `PATH` or set
> other environment variables like `ROCM_HOME`.
>
> See also [this issue](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/1658) discussing

### Installing multi-arch native Linux packages

In addition to Python wheels and tarballs, ROCm native Linux packages are
published for Debian-based and RPM-based distributions via the
multi-arch pipeline.

> [!WARNING]
> These builds are primarily intended for development and testing and are
> currently **unsigned**.

Multi-arch native packages use a simplified package model compared to the
[per-family native packages](#installing-from-native-packages):

| Package name       | Description                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `amdrocm`          | Installs all base ROCm libraries and runtime support for all supported GPU architectures                         |
| `amdrocm-core-sdk` | Installs the full ROCm SDK including runtime, development tools, and headers for all supported GPU architectures |

> [!TIP]
> To find the latest available release, browse the index pages:
>
> - **Debian packages**: https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/packages-multi-arch/deb/
> - **RPM packages**: https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/packages-multi-arch/rpm/
>
> Look for directories in the format `YYYYMMDD-<action-run-id>`
> (e.g., `20260501-25200531110`) and use the latest in the commands below.

#### Installing on Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

```bash
# Step 1: Find the latest release from
#         https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/packages-multi-arch/deb/
#         Look for directories like "20260501-25200531110"
# Step 2: Set the variable below
export RELEASE_ID=20260501-25200531110  # Replace with the latest date-runid

# Step 3: Add repository and install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/packages-multi-arch/deb/${RELEASE_ID} stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm-multiarch-nightly.list
sudo apt update

# Install base runtime for all supported GPU architectures:
sudo apt install amdrocm
# Or install full SDK (runtime + dev tools + headers) for all supported GPU architectures:
sudo apt install amdrocm-core-sdk
```

#### Installing on RPM-based systems (RHEL, SLES, AlmaLinux, etc.)

```bash
# Step 1: Find the latest release from
#         https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/packages-multi-arch/rpm/
#         Look for directories like "20260501-25200531110"
# Step 2: Set the variable below
export RELEASE_ID=20260501-25200531110  # Replace with the latest date-runid

# Step 3: Add repository and install
sudo dnf install -y ca-certificates
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/rocm-multiarch-nightly.repo <<EOF
[rocm-multiarch-nightly]
name=ROCm Multi-Arch Nightly Repository
baseurl=https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/packages-multi-arch/rpm/${RELEASE_ID}/x86_64
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
priority=50
EOF

# Install base runtime for all supported GPU architectures:
sudo dnf clean all
sudo dnf install amdrocm
# Or install full SDK (runtime + dev tools + headers) for all supported GPU architectures:
sudo dnf install amdrocm-core-sdk
```

> [!NOTE]
> To install support for a specific GPU architecture only, you can use the
> per-arch package variant (e.g., `apt install amdrocm-gfx942` or `dnf install amdrocm-gfx942`). For a full list of
> supported GPU targets and their identifiers, see
> [Supported Python `[device-*]` install extras](#supported-python-device--install-extras).

## Per-family releases

Per-family releases use **GPU-family-specific index URLs** — you choose the
index URL that matches your GPU family, and all packages for that family are
served from that URL.

> [!NOTE]
> Multi-arch releases (above) are the newer approach and will soon replace
> per-family releases. Both are available during the transition.

### Installing per-family releases using pip

We recommend installing ROCm and projects like PyTorch and JAX via `pip`, the
[Python package installer](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/).

We currently support Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 (PyTorch 2.9+ only).

> [!TIP]
> We highly recommend working within a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
>
> ```bash
> python -m venv .venv
> source .venv/bin/activate
> ```
>
> Multiple virtual environments can be present on a system at a time, allowing you to switch between them at will.

> [!WARNING]
> If you _really_ want a system-wide install, you can pass `--break-system-packages` to `pip` outside a virtual environment.
> In this case, commandline interface shims for executables are installed to `/usr/local/bin`, which normally has precedence over `/usr/bin` and might therefore conflict with a previous installation of ROCm.

#### Python packages release status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Known issues with the Python wheels are tracked at
> https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/808.

#### Index page listing

For now, `rocm`, `torch`, and `jax` packages are published to GPU-architecture-specific index
pages and must be installed using an appropriate `--find-links` argument to `pip`.
They may later be pushed to the
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) or other channels using a process
like https://wheelnext.dev/. **Please check back regularly
as these instructions will change as we migrate to official indexes and adjust
project layouts.**

#### Installing ROCm Python packages

We provide several Python packages which together form the complete ROCm SDK.

- See [ROCm Python Packaging via TheRock](./docs/packaging/python_packaging.md)
  for information about the each package.
- The packages are defined in the
  [`build_tools/packaging/python/templates/`](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/tree/main/build_tools/packaging/python/templates)
  directory.

| Package name         | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `rocm`               | Primary sdist meta package that dynamically determines other deps  |
| `rocm-sdk-core`      | OS-specific core of the ROCm SDK (e.g. compiler and utility tools) |
| `rocm-sdk-libraries` | OS-specific libraries                                              |
| `rocm-sdk-devel`     | OS-specific development tools                                      |

##### Optional profiler package

A new optional package `rocm-profiler` is available, providing ROCm profiling tools:

- ROCm Systems Profiler (rocprofiler-systems)
- ROCm Compute Profiler (rocprofiler-compute)

###### Installing the profiler package

Install profiling tools via the meta package:

```bash
pip install "rocm[profiler]"
```

This will install:

- `rocm-sdk-core` (required runtime + SDK)
- `rocm-profiler` (profiling tools)

Install instructions:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx120X-all/ "rocm[libraries,devel]"
```

#### Using ROCm Python packages

After installing the ROCm Python packages, you should see them in your
environment:

```bash
pip freeze | grep rocm
# rocm==6.5.0rc20250610
# rocm-sdk-core==6.5.0rc20250610
# rocm-sdk-devel==6.5.0rc20250610
# rocm-sdk-libraries-gfx110X-all==6.5.0rc20250610
```

You should also see various tools on your `PATH` and in the `bin` directory:

```bash
which rocm-sdk
# .../.venv/bin/rocm-sdk

ls .venv/bin
# activate       amdclang++    hipcc      python                 rocm-sdk
# activate.csh   amdclang-cl   hipconfig  python3                rocm-smi
# activate.fish  amdclang-cpp  pip        python3.12             roc-obj
# Activate.ps1   amdflang      pip3       rocm_agent_enumerator  roc-obj-extract
# amdclang       amdlld        pip3.12    rocminfo               roc-obj-ls
```

The `rocm-sdk` tool can be used to inspect and test the installation:

```console
$ rocm-sdk --help
usage: rocm-sdk {command} ...

ROCm SDK Python CLI

positional arguments:
  {path,test,version,targets,init}
    path                Print various paths to ROCm installation
    test                Run installation tests to verify integrity
    version             Print version information
    targets             Print information about the GPU targets that are supported
    init                Expand devel contents to initialize rocm[devel]

$ rocm-sdk test
...
Ran 22 tests in 8.284s
OK

$ rocm-sdk targets
gfx1100;gfx1101;gfx1102
```

To initialize the `rocm[devel]` package, use the `rocm-sdk` tool to _eagerly_ expand development
contents:

```console
$ rocm-sdk init
Devel contents expanded to '.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/_rocm_sdk_devel'
```

These contents are useful for using the package outside of Python and _lazily_ expanded on the
first use when used from Python.

Once you have verified your installation, you can continue to use it for
standard ROCm development or install PyTorch, JAX, or another supported Python ML
framework.

#### Installing PyTorch Python packages

Using the index pages [listed above](#installing-rocm-python-packages), you can
also install `torch`, `torchaudio`, `torchvision`, and `apex`.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, pip will install the latest stable versions of each package.
>
> - If you want to allow installing prerelease versions, use the `--pre`
>
> - If you want to install other versions, take note of the compatibility
>   matrix:
>
>   | torch version | torchaudio version | torchvision version | apex version |
>   | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
>   | 2.10          | 2.10               | 0.25                | 1.10.0       |
>   | 2.9           | 2.9                | 0.24                | 1.9.0        |
>   | 2.8           | 2.8                | 0.23                | 1.8.0        |
>
>   For example, `torch` 2.8 and compatible wheels can be installed by specifying
>
>   ```
>   torch==2.8 torchaudio==2.8 torchvision==0.23 apex==1.8.0
>   ```

> [!WARNING]
> The `torch` packages depend on `rocm[libraries]`, so the compatible ROCm packages
> should be installed automatically for you and you do not need to explicitly install
> ROCm first. If ROCm is already installed this may result in a downgrade if the
> `torch` wheel to be installed requires a different version.

> [!TIP]
> If you previously installed PyTorch with the `pytorch-triton-rocm` package,
> please uninstall it before installing the new packages:
>
> ```bash
> pip uninstall pytorch-triton-rocm
> ```
>
> The triton package is now named `triton`.

#### Installing JAX Python packages

Using the index pages [listed above](#installing-rocm-python-packages), you can
also install `jaxlib`, `jax_rocm7_plugin`, and `jax_rocm7_pjrt`.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, pip will install the latest stable versions of each package.
>
> - If you want to install other versions, the currently supported versions are:
>
>   | jax version | jaxlib version   |
>   | ----------- | ---------------- |
>   | 0.9.2       | 0.9.2 (upstream) |
>   | 0.9.1       | 0.9.1 (upstream) |
>   | 0.8.2       | 0.8.2            |
>   | 0.8.0       | 0.8.0            |
>
>   See also
>
>   - [Supported JAX versions in TheRock](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/tree/main/external-builds/jax#supported-jax-versions)

> [!WARNING]
> Unlike PyTorch, the JAX wheels do **not** automatically install `rocm[libraries]`
> as a dependency. You must have ROCm installed separately via a
> [tarball installation](#installing-from-tarballs).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `jax` package itself is **not** published to the TheRock index.
> After installing `jaxlib`, `jax_rocm7_plugin`, and `jax_rocm7_pjrt` from the
> GPU-family index, install `jax` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/jax/):
>
> ```bash
> pip install jax
> ```

```python
import jax

print(jax.devices())
# [RocmDevice(id=0)]
```

For building JAX from source or running the full JAX test suite, see the
[external-builds/jax README](/external-builds/jax/README.md).

### Installing from tarballs

Standalone "ROCm SDK tarballs" are a flattened view of ROCm
[artifacts](docs/development/artifacts.md) matching the familiar folder
structure seen with system installs on Linux to `/opt/rocm/` or on Windows via
the HIP SDK:

```bash
install/  # Extracted tarball location, file path of your choosing
  .info/
  bin/
  clients/
  include/
  lib/
  libexec/
  share/
```

Tarballs are _just_ these raw files. They do not come with "install" steps
such as setting environment variables.

> [!WARNING]
> Tarballs and per-commit CI artifacts are primarily intended for developers
> and CI workflows.
>
> For most users, we recommend installing via package managers:
>
> - [Installing multi-arch releases using pip](#installing-multi-arch-rocm-python-packages)
> - [Installing per-family releases using pip](#installing-per-family-releases-using-pip)
> - [Installing from native packages](#installing-from-native-packages)

#### Browsing release tarballs

Release tarballs are uploaded to the following locations:

| Tarball index                             | S3 bucket                                                                                | Description                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| https://repo.amd.com/rocm/tarball/        | (not publicly accessible)                                                                | Stable releases                                    |
| https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/tarball/   | [`therock-nightly-tarball`](https://therock-nightly-tarball.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) | Nightly builds from the default development branch |
| https://rocm.prereleases.amd.com/tarball/ | (not publicly accessible)                                                                | ⚠️ Prerelease builds for QA testing ⚠️             |
| https://rocm.devreleases.amd.com/tarball/ | [`therock-dev-tarball`](https://therock-dev-tarball.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)         | ⚠️ Development builds from project maintainers ⚠️  |

#### Manual tarball extraction

To download a tarball and extract it into place manually:

```bash
mkdir therock-tarball && cd therock-tarball
# For example...
wget https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/tarball/therock-dist-linux-gfx110X-all-7.12.0a20260202.tar.gz
mkdir install && tar -xf *.tar.gz -C install
```

#### Automated tarball extraction

For more control over artifact installation—including per-commit CI builds,
specific release versions, the latest nightly release, and component
selection—see the
[Installing Artifacts](docs/development/installing_artifacts.md) developer
documentation. The
[`install_rocm_from_artifacts.py`](build_tools/install_rocm_from_artifacts.py)
script can be used to install artifacts from a variety of sources.

#### Using installed tarballs

After installing (downloading and extracting) a tarball, you can test it by
running programs from the `bin/` directory:

```bash
ls install
# bin  include  lib  libexec  llvm  share

# Now test some of the installed tools:
./install/bin/rocminfo
./install/bin/test_hip_api
```

> [!TIP]
> You may also want to add parts of the install directory to your `PATH` or set
> other environment variables like `ROCM_HOME`.
>
> See also [this issue](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/1658) discussing
> relevant environment variables.

> [!TIP]
> After extracting a tarball, metadata about which commits were used to build
> TheRock can be found in the `share/therock/therock_manifest.json` file:
>
> ```bash
> cat install/share/therock/therock_manifest.json
> # {
> #   "the_rock_commit": "567dd890a3bc3261ffb26ae38b582378df298374",
> #   "submodules": [
> #     {
> #       "submodule_name": "half",
> #       "submodule_path": "base/half",
> #       "submodule_url": "https://github.com/ROCm/half.git",
> #       "pin_sha": "207ee58595a64b5c4a70df221f1e6e704b807811",
> #       "patches": []
> #     },
> #     ...
> ```

### Installing from native packages

In addition to Python wheels and tarballs, ROCm native Linux packages are
published for Debian-based and RPM-based distributions.

> [!WARNING]
> These builds are primarily intended for development and testing and are currently **unsigned**.

>   - **Debian packages**: https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/deb/
>   - **RPM packages**: https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/rpm/
> - **Step 2**: Look for directories in the format `YYYYMMDD-<action-run-id>` (e.g., `20260310-12345678`)
> - **Step 3**: Use the latest date in the installation commands below

#### Installing on Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

```bash
# Step 1: Find the latest release from https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/deb/
#         Look for directories like "20260310-12345678"
# Step 2: Look at the "GPU family and package mapping" table above to find
#         the GFX Family for your GPU (e.g., gfx94x, gfx110x, gfx1151)
# Step 3: Set the variables below

export RELEASE_ID=20260310-12345678  # Replace with actual date-runid
export GFX_ARCH=gfx110x              # Replace with GFX Family from the mapping table

# Step 4: Add repository and install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/deb/${RELEASE_ID} stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm-nightly.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install amdrocm-core-sdk-${GFX_ARCH}
# If only runtime is needed, install amdrocm-${GFX_ARCH} instead
```

#### Installing on RPM-based systems (RHEL, SLES, AlmaLinux etc.)

> [!NOTE]
> The following instructions are for RHEL-based operating systems.

```bash
# Step 1: Find the latest release from https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/rpm/
#         Look for directories like "20260310-12345678"
# Step 2: Look at the "GPU family and package mapping" table above to find
#         the GFX Family for your GPU (e.g., gfx94x, gfx110x, gfx1151)
# Step 3: Set the variables below

export RELEASE_ID=20260310-12345678  # Replace with actual date-runid
export GFX_ARCH=gfx110x              # Replace with GFX Family from the mapping table

# Step 4: Add repository and install
sudo dnf install -y ca-certificates
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/rocm-nightly.repo <<EOF
[rocm-nightly]
name=ROCm Nightly Repository
baseurl=https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/rpm/${RELEASE_ID}/x86_64
enabled=1

```

## Verifying your installation

After installing ROCm via any of the methods above, you can verify that your
GPU is properly recognized.

### Verifying installation on Linux

GPU status on Linux can be checked via either:

```bash
rocminfo
# or
amd-smi
```

### Verifying installation on Windows

GPU status on Windows can be checked via

```bash
hipInfo.exe
```

### Additional installation troubleshooting

If your GPU is not recognized or you encounter issues:

- **Linux users**: Check system logs using `dmesg | grep amdgpu` for specific error messages
- Review memory allocation settings (see the [FAQ](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/faq.md)
  for GTT configuration on unified memory systems)
- Ensure you have the latest [AMDGPU driver](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html#amdgpu-driver-installation)
  on Linux or [Adrenaline driver](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adrenalin.html) on Windows
- For platform-specific troubleshooting when using PyTorch or JAX, see:
  - [Using ROCm Python packages](#using-rocm-python-packages)
  - [Using PyTorch Python packages](#using-pytorch-python-packages)
  - [Using JAX Python packages](#using-jax-python-packages)
